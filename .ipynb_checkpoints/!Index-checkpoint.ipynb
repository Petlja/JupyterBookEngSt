    "# Introduction to Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an _Introduction to Data Science_. In ten lectures we overview and demonstrate a set of basic skills that everyone needs in order to visualize data and perform some fundamental data analysis. The idea of this handbook is to demonstrate how, with a little bit of _Python_ programming, from a conveniently represented data you can get a new quality -- information. This handbook is written in _Jupyter_, which is an interactive environment ideal for experimenting with snippets of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our programming language of choice is Python, this handbook is _not_ meant to teach Python programming. The goal of this hanbook is to demonstrate basic skills needed for data visualisation and data analysis, while the programming language is just a tool that makes it possible for us to formulate out ideas precisely and apply them on concrete examples. Python is a modern programming language that is constantly being upgraded and regularly maintained, and which is free to use. That makes it a convenient choice.\n",
